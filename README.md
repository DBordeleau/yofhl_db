# üèí YOFHL Fantasy Hockey Database

This is a **Next.js** web application that displays historical data for the **YOFHL Fantasy Hockey League**, inspired by [HockeyDB](https://www.hockeydb.com/). The app features clean stat tables, dynamic routing, and a fast, responsive frontend.

It uses the **Next.js App Router** with dynamic URLs to serve context-specific data pulled from a **PostgreSQL** database enabling users to explore stats in a way that is impossible with our native fantasy platform.
